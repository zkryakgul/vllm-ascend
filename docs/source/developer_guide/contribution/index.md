## Building and testing
It's recommended to set up a local development environment to build and test
before you submit a PR.

### Setup development environment

Theoretically, the vllm-ascend build is only supported on Linux because
`vllm-ascend` dependency `torch_npu` only supports Linux.

But you can still set up dev env on Linux/Windows/macOS for linting and basic
test as following commands:

```bash
# Choose a base dir (~/vllm-project/) and set up venv
cd ~/vllm-project/
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate

# Clone vllm code and install
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
cd vllm
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE="empty" pip install .
cd ..

# Clone vllm-ascend and install
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend.git
cd vllm-ascend
# install system requirement
apt install -y gcc g++ cmake libnuma-dev
# install project requirement
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Then you can run lint and mypy test
bash format.sh

# Build:
# - only supported on Linux (torch_npu available)
# pip install -e .
# - build without deps for debugging in other OS
# pip install -e . --no-deps
# - build without custom ops
# COMPILE_CUSTOM_KERNELS=0 pip install -e .

# Commit changed files using `-s`
git commit -sm "your commit info"
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have completed the development environment setup.

### Test locally

You can refer to [Testing](./testing.md) doc to help you setup testing environment and running tests locally.

## DCO and Signed-off-by

When contributing changes to this project, you must agree to the DCO. Commits must include a `Signed-off-by:` header which certifies agreement with the terms of the DCO.

Using `-s` with `git commit` will automatically add this header.

## PR Title and Classification

Only specific types of PRs will be reviewed. The PR title is prefixed appropriately to indicate the type of change. Please use one of the following:

- `[Attention]` for new features or optimization in attention.
- `[Communicator]` for new features or optimization in communicators.
- `[ModelRunner]` for new features or optimization in model runner.
- `[Platform]` for new features or optimization in platform.
- `[Worker]` for new features or optimization in worker.
- `[Core]` for new features or optimization  in the core vllm-ascend logic (such as platform, attention, communicators, model runner)
- `[Kernel]` changes affecting compute kernels and ops.
- `[Bugfix]` for bug fixes.
- `[Doc]` for documentation fixes and improvements.
- `[Test]` for tests (such as unit tests).
- `[CI]` for build or continuous integration improvements.
- `[Misc]` for PRs that do not fit the above categories. Please use this sparingly.

:::{note}
If the PR spans more than one category, please include all relevant prefixes.
