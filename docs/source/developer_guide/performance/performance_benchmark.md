# Performance Benchmark
This document details the benchmark methodology for vllm-ascend, aimed at evaluating the performance under a variety of workloads. To maintain alignment with vLLM, we use the [benchmark](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/benchmarks) script provided by the vllm project.

**Benchmark Coverage**: We measure offline e2e latency and throughput, and fixed-QPS online serving benchmarks, for more details see [vllm-ascend benchmark scripts](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/tree/main/benchmarks).

## 1. Run docker container
```{code-block} bash
   :substitutions:
# Update DEVICE according to your device (/dev/davinci[0-7])
export DEVICE=/dev/davinci7
export IMAGE=m.daocloud.io/quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:|vllm_ascend_version|
docker run --rm \
--name vllm-ascend \
--device $DEVICE \
--device /dev/davinci_manager \
--device /dev/devmm_svm \
--device /dev/hisi_hdc \
-v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
-v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
-v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
-v /root/.cache:/root/.cache \
-p 8000:8000 \
-e VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=True \
-e PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:256 \
-it $IMAGE \
/bin/bash
```

## 2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd /workspace/vllm-ascend
pip config set global.index-url https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple
pip install -r benchmarks/requirements-bench.txt
```

## 3. (Optional)Prepare model weights
For faster running speed, we recommend downloading the model in advanceï¼š
```bash
modelscope download --model LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

You can also replace all model paths in the [json](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/tree/main/benchmarks/tests) files with your local paths:
```bash
[
  {
    "test_name": "latency_llama8B_tp1",
    "parameters": {
      "model": "your local model path",
      "tensor_parallel_size": 1,
      "load_format": "dummy",
      "num_iters_warmup": 5,
      "num_iters": 15
    }
  }
]
```

## 4. Run benchmark script
Run benchmark script:
```bash
bash benchmarks/scripts/run-performance-benchmarks.sh
```

After about 10 mins, the output is as shown below:
